# OpenFOAM_Spectra

The two python files compute the energy spectra
using the probes files generated by OpenFOAM. 
Note that the file must be coherent with the probesDict file that has been given as input 
to OpenFOAM before the simulation.
In order to generate the probesDict file, and, therefore, have a velocity (u,v,w) file in 
(y,z) plane versus time, please use the probeSurface package.
